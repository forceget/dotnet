<h1>Automatic Pricing System</h1>
<p>This system provides prices for transporting goods from one place to another, specifically for a logistics company. The system automatically generates a price proposal based on given inputs (such as the weight of the goods to be transported, the distance, and the type of transportation). This system is written in C# .Net Core 5.0.</p>
<p>To use this system, users must create an account and obtain a token.</p>
<p>This system is intended to be used for integration purposes. Users who are interested in using this system should carefully review the code to understand how to make requests to the appropriate API endpoints and how to handle filters and other functionality.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The system requests the following inputs from the user:</p>

  <li>Weight of the goods to be transported (in kg)</li>
  <li>Starting and ending points of the journey (addresses or coordinates)</li>
  <li>Type of transportation (land, sea, or air)</li>
</ul>
<p>After the user inputs this information and provides a valid token, the system proposes a price. The user can accept the proposal and place an order, or reject the proposal and change the inputs.</p>
